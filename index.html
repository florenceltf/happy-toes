      Once upon a time, during the 2020 global pandemic, two friends were locked inside a cottage in the quintessentially English village of Bearsted.

      About
    </h2>
    <p>
      My name is Caroline. I‚Äôm a big fan of yoga. I like what it does to my body. I like how it makes me feel. I like
      the quietening effect it has on my mind.

      I trained under Troy Abraham in Melbourne, Australia. I then travelled to Mysore, India to learn from Pranavashya
      practitioner, Vinay Kumar.

      My style of teaching combines breath with movement. If you are curious and have never tried yoga before, if you
      are a pro in need of a push, or if you would like to simply sit with me and breathe, please get in touch.

      I would love to teach you.

  <section id="what">
    <h2>
      Vinyasa Flow : What Is It?
    </h2>
    <p>Vinyasa Flow is a yoga style that concentrates on synchronising breath with movement. It is an extension of
      Ashtanga ‚Äî however it does not follow a rigid series in the same way as Ashtanga, meaning each session is
      different.

      We use postures from the Ashtanga primary and secondary series and flow them together with vinyasas (a
      mini-sequence of high-to-low plank into upward facing dog and back to downward facing dog). Vinyasa sessions vary
      in pace, from power flow to slow flow, with styles that match different levels of yogis and their individual wants
      and needs.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Is it suitable for beginners?
    </h2>
    <p>
      My classes are suitable for all levels ‚Äî particularly beginners. Even if you have been practising all your life, I
      like you to pretend you are brand new to yoga and encourage you to really feel your body in each pose. We will
      break down simple poses, so that you get to feel the difference between a correctly engaged and incorrectly
      engaged posture ‚Äî and this is important.

      Yoga is wonderful, however like any sport it can have detrimental effects if practised with bad form. All too
      often we think yoga is about being flexible, and this is a big no. Hyper-mobility is the biggest cause of
      back-pain in yoga, and does not create strength. So we will go back to basics over and over again to let go of old
      habits and keep our practice moving forward.

  <section id="why">
    <h2>
      Why Do It?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Other than for the amazing lycra onesies you mean? The benefits of yoga are too long to list here, it is a tried
      and tested practice that goes back thousands of years. In fact some yogis believe that each posture holds
      tremendous health benefits for all sorts of ailments.

      For me yoga is a way to stay active and move my body in a world that wants me to spend my waking day sat hunched
      over a computer. It opens me up, unclutters my mind, and allows me to build strength in a way no other sport can.
      It's a beautiful experience and one I am very grateful to practise and teach.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Will I Stand On My Head?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Well yes! If that is what you want to do. But if you don't, then no. Yoga is a personal practice and you can take
      it at your own pace, always listening to your body and doing what is right for you. Above all, yoga should be fun
      and not about taking yourself too seriously.

      I will help you get into a headstand if that's what you want, but I will also ensure you do it properly and get
      there step by step by having fun in other positions along the way.

      Ready To Give It a Try?

    <p>
      I am based in Bearsted, Kent and am available for group or private sessions in the comfort of your own home.
      During the summer months, I will also offer classes in my garden. I have a full time business so I teach in in my
      spare time being :
      Wednesdays & Fridays 6pm ‚Äî 9pm
      Weekends (anytime)

      I charge ¬£45 per group session with up to 5 per group, for 60 minutes. I charge ¬£30 per individual session for 60
      minutes and ¬£40 for 90 minutes. My classes are a mixture of asanas (postures), pranayama (breathing) and we will
      end with 5 minutes savasana (sleeping). In all my sessions I like to spend some time breaking down postures to
      focus on alignment.

      All you have to do is contact me via phone or email to arrange your next class. I look forward to teaching you.
